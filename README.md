This repository contains the main Python projects completed as part of the **CS50 AI: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Harvard** course.

## Projects Included

- `knights.py`: [Brief description, e.g., solving knights problem with logic inference]
- `crossword.py`: Crossword puzzle solver using constraint satisfaction
- `degrees.py`: Shortest path calculation in a social graph
- `heredity.py`: Genetic inheritance probability calculator
- `mask.py`: [Brief description]
- `nim.py`: Implementation of the Nim game with AI strategies
- `pagerank.py`: PageRank algorithm implementation
- `play.py`: [Brief description]
- `shopping.py`: [Brief description]

*For detailed descriptions and usage instructions, see the comments in each script.*

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash

````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd cs50ai-main-projects
   ```

3. Run the Python scripts using Python 3.8+:

   ```bash
   python3 knights.py
   ```

   *(Replace `knights.py` with the script you want to run)*

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher
* No external libraries required (or list if any)
